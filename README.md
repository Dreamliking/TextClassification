# TextClassification\<br>
Implement two neural networks for multi-class text classification problem.\<br>
## Models
1. A LSTM classifier with dropout and L2 regularization.
2. A CNN classifier with dropout and L2 regularization. The model was built from [this tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)
