# Multi-class Text Classification
Implement two neural networks for multi-class text classification problem.
## Models
* A LSTM classifier with dropout and L2 regularization.
* A CNN classifier with dropout and L2 regularization. The model was built from [this tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/).
## Train
train.py supports the training of both cnn and rnn. Cross-validation was implemented to measure the goodness of a model.
