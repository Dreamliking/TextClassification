# Multi-class Text Classification
Implement two neural networks for multi-class text classification problem.
## Models
* A basic LSTM classifier.
* A basic CNN classifier. The model was built from [this tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/).
* A C-LSTM classifier. The model was based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08630).
## Train
Run train.py to train the models. Cross validation was implemented to test the goodness of a model.
